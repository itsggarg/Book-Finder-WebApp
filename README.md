## Component Overview

- App.js: Main application component handling routing and global state
- SearchBar.js: Handles user input and search functionality
- BookList.js: Displays search results in a responsive grid
- BookItem.js: Individual book card component with cover image handling
- BookDetail.js: Detailed view of individual books with comprehensive information

## API Integration

The application integrates with the Open Library API for book data. Key endpoints used include:

- Search: https://openlibrary.org/search.json
- Book details: https://openlibrary.org/works/{id}.json
- Book covers: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/{cover_id}-{size}.jpg

## Performance Considerations

The application implements several performance optimizations:

- Memoization of styles and computed values
- Lazy loading of book cover images
- Efficient state management using React hooks
- Debounced search functionality
- Optimized rendering patterns

## Accessibility

The application follows accessibility best practices:

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Proper color contrast ratios
- Screen reader-friendly content structure

## Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling is implemented throughout the application:

- Network request error handling
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading state indicators
